# TicTacToe
This is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java. It allows two players to play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 board.

# How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
https://github.com/your- username/tic -tac - toe. git
git
clone
2. Open the project in yourfavorite Java IDE.
3. Locate the TicTacToe.java file and open it.
4. Run the program. The game will start, and the initial empty board will be displayed.
5. Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column numbers of their
desired position on the board.
6. The game will check the validity of the move and update the board accordingly.
7. The game continues until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.
8. After the game ends, the final board will be displayed, and the winner (if any) will be
announced.

# How It Works
The game utilizes a 2D array, board, to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board. Each player is assigned either 'X' or 'O' as their marker. The players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column numbers. The program checks the validity of the move, updates the board, and checks for a win condition after each move. The game ends when a player wins or the board is completely filled.
